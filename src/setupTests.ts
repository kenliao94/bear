// This code imports the jest-dom library, which provides additional custom matchers for Jest testing framework. These matchers can be used to make assertions on DOM nodes, such as checking for the presence of specific text. The import statement enables the use of these matchers in Jest tests. The link to the library's GitHub page is also provided for more information.

// jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
